# NFL-Rush

## How to run the project?
Open Two terminals

### `cd into server`
### `cd into nfl-rush`

in both folders run: `npm install`

## In the server folder run:
### `node app`

## In the nfl-rush folder run:
### `yarn start`

The reason for running both application on terminals is because they're currently running on different ports

## What is the stack of this technology?

This Full stack application is built using 
- ReactJs
- Apollo GraphQL
- Mongodb
- NodeJs
- Express

And for testing I used react-testing-library

The reason for this stack is React is one of the most powerful front-end tools used today and I felt the most comfortable using it

Mongodb was quick database idea mainly because the data structure was unknown and the ease of being able to import a document into a table very easily

GraphQL is one of the most amazing querying tools I've have ever used and I love how easily I am able to structure the query to recieve the data I want to see without having other unnecessary items be part of it

Express is just a simple standard library to create RESTFUL API's
